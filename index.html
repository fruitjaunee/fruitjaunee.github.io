<h1>Optimal sequences alignement</h1>

</br>


<p>In order to find an optimal alignment between two sequences we defined a score system: we determine a score when two caracters are identical, another when they are not and another when a caracter is aligned with a gap. The final score of the aligment is the sum of all the scores. The optimal alignment is the one that has the higher score of all the possible alignments.</p>
<p>The user can enter 2 sequences that he wants to compare as well as the match score, the missmatch score and the score gap that he desire.</p>
